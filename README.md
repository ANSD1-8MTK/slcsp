# SLCSP INTERVIEW EXERCISE

This is my solution for the Ad Hoc SLCSP - Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan -
coding exercise, written in Python.


## QUICK SETUP AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Install Python 3.7+ if it is not already installed on your system.
2. Download or `git clone` this repository to copy the files to your machine.
3. In a command/shell/terminal window, navigate to the directory you have copied
   the files to.
4. (Optional) If need be, unzip all of the files.

With Python and the code in place on your machine, you have everything you need!

To run the script and see the results, run the following command in your
command/terminal/shell window or session:

```
python slcsp.py
```

To run the tests, run the following command:

```
python tests.py
```

approach, please see the COMMENTS.md file.
